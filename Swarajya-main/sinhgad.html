	<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>Sinhagad, meaning "Lion's Fort," is located in the Pune district of Maharashtra, India. Situated on the Bhuleshwar range of the Sahyadri Mountains, this fort has witnessed many historic battles, including the Battle of Sinhagad in 1670. The fort is located around 35 km (22 mi) southwest of Pune, and stands at an elevation of 1,312 m (4,304 ft) above sea level.<br> The fort offers stunning views of the surrounding areas and is a popular destination for trekking and history enthusiasts. Due to its strategic location, it was an important fort in the Maratha Empire under Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's rule.</p>
	<h3>History</h3>
		<p>Sinhagad has a rich history. The most famous battle fought here was between the Marathas and the Mughals in 1670, where Tanaji Malusare, one of Shivaji Maharaj's generals, sacrificed his life to recapture the fort from the Mughals. This battle is remembered for Tanaji's bravery, and in his honor, the fort was renamed "Sinhagad" (Lion's Fort) by Shivaji Maharaj. The fort was initially known as "Kondhana." It has been controlled by various rulers, including the Mughals and the British, before it finally became a part of independent India.</p>
